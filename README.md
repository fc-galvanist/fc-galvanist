## Hi there 👋


We are the Ferric Collective.

Our Manifesto:
1.  Imperfection is a feature - We believe that the natural variability of hardware [Valves, Transistors]
    and procedural variability in software [non linearity, randomness] can be used to produce desirable imperfections in our products.  
    
3.  We share everything - We release our Software under GPLv3, our hardware under CERN-OHL-S-2.0 and our documents and images under Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0)
4.  We publish and we implment - We believe in defensive prior art
5.  We believe in transparency, provenance and chains of custody - We embrace the Neural/AI revolution, but we do not embrace the murky lack of provenence used in training models.
    The ethical hazard of using unauthorised code to train models for commercial gain is a great problem of our time.
    We use only material that is appropriately licenced, we upload it, we use hashes to validate the files we use. 
7.  We use cryptography to authenticate, not obfuscate
8.  We are slightly dramatic - We embrace the design of equipment that feels 'eldritch', we use iron, steel, voodoo.
    We cast spells in code, out native language is C++, our liturgical language is Fortran
    We design floating displays, dramatic lighting, equipment that is unique and batch numbered.  We use solid wood panel when veneered plywood would do.
